        "answer": "Our team does NOT have access to your bank accounts. We organize everything and send for your approval via app. Only you have authorization to approve or reject payments. It's 100% secure."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to be 100% operational?",
        "answer": "In 30 days your finances will be completely organized and operational. We have a structured week-by-week onboarding process with dedicated support."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it cheaper than hiring an employee?",
        "answer": "Yes! A financial analyst costs on average $3,500 + benefits (total ~$7,000). Our plans start at $1,200/month with an entire team taking care of your finances."

      {
        "question": "Do I need to change my accountant?",
        "answer": "No! We handle financial management (cash flow, payments, receivables). Your accountant continues handling the tax and accounting part. Actually, we make their job easier with organized documents."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the approval app work?",
        "answer": "You receive a daily WhatsApp notification with a secure link. When you click, you access our app where you see all payments for the day with details. In 2-3 minutes you approve or reject each one."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't like the service?",
        "answer": "We have a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not satisfied, we return 100% of the amount paid. But that has never happened - 100% of our clients renew."

        "question": "What size companies do you serve?",
